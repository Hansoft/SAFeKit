Hansoft Scaled Agile Support Kit
================================

An add-on to Hansoft for working with the Scaled Agile Framework
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This kit is in part based on the available descriptions of the [Scaled Agile Framework] [1]. 

The kit provides a “template” Hansoft database which defines a set of custom columns,
user groups, reports, view presets and suggested structures for the product backlog and the
project schedule in Hansoft. To complement the template database there are additional
customizations to automatically calculate/update summary fields with [Jean for Hansoft] [2]
and also a Hansoft client plugin to add custom menu options to the Hansoft client.

How to install and configure the kit is described in the document [SafeSupportKitForHansoft.docx] [3].
